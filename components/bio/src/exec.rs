/// installed before recomputing.  There are a maximum number of times
/// a re-installation will be attempted before returning an error.
///
/// # Notes on Package Installation
///
/// By default, Biome will install packages from the `stable`
/// channel. However, if you'd rather use unstable (particularly if
/// you're developing Biome), you'll need to set the
/// `INTERNAL_TOOLING_CHANNEL_ENVVAR` appropriately.
///
/// Note that this environment variable *only* applies to packages
/// installed through this function. As a result, this function should
/// only be used to install Biome packages (i.e. things Biome
/// itself needs to run), and not arbitrary user packages. This allows
/// users to fine-tune where packages come from.
///
/// Also note that due to the "minimum package" logic, this overriding
/// of the internal tooling channel logic is really only called for
/// when first encountering a given package; thereafter, we can use
/// whatever is on disk already. This provides another mechanism by
/// which you can influence what packages are used: simply install a
/// newer one.
///
/// # Failures
///
/// * If the package is installed but the command cannot be found in the package
/// * If an error occurs when loading the local package from disk
/// * If the maximum number of installation retries has been exceeded
