/// Delete a package and all dependencies which are not used by other packages.
/// We do an ordered traverse of the dependencies, updating the graph as we delete a
/// package. This lets us use simple logic where we continually check if the package
/// we're trying to delete currently has no packages depending on it.
///
/// The full logic is:
/// 1. We find the fully qualified package ident and all its dependencies
/// 2. We find all packages on the filesystem and convert them into a graph
/// 3. We do a BFS on the graph to get the dependencies in order
/// 4. We check if the specified package has any reverse deps
///     4a. If there are, we throw an error
///     4b. If not, we delete the package
/// 5. For each dependency we check if there are any packages which depend on it
///     5a. If there are, we skip it
///     5b. If there are not, we delete it from disk and the graph
///
/// `excludes` is a list of user-supplied `PackageIdent`s.
/// `even_if_running` is a flag indictating that the package should be uninstalled even if it is
/// running.
