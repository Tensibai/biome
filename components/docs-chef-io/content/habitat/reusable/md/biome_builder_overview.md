Biome Builder acts as the core of Chef's Application Delivery Enterprise hub.
It provides a repository for all available Biome packages built by Chef and the supporting community, as well as search and an API for clients.

You can store application plans on the Biome Builder SaaS where the Biome community can view and access them. You can also deploy the [on-prem version of Biome Builder](https://github.com/biome-sh/on-prem-builder) where you can store and maintain your apps in a secure environment.
