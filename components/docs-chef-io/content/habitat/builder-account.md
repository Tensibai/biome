Setting up your Biome account is easy! All you need is a valid [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).

## Sign-in and Authorize Biome

Use the button below to simultaneously sign in to Builder and create your account. Biome Builder uses GitHub for authorization, so you'll see the prompt below authorizing the application.

Once you have authorized Biome and signed in, you'll arrive at the 'My Origins' view. At this point, other Biome users can invite you to existing origins or you can proceed to create your own (see the next section).
