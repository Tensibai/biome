**Examples: [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)**

Provisioning tools like Terraform or CloudFormation enable you to write a configuration file to manage infrastructure resources. The configuration file is used along with a CLI tool to create, read, update, and delete infrastructure resources in a declarative way. Biome is not a provisioning tool and works well with the provisioning tool of your choice.
