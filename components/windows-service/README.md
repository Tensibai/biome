# Windows-Service

A Windows service that runs the Biome Supervisor

## Requirements

The only requirement is that you have the Biome cli (bio.exe) installed and on your path.

## Installation

To install the Biome Windows service, run:

```
bio pkg install biome/windows-service
```

This will install the package and invoke its `install` hook creating the service in the Windows Service Control Manager (SCM). You can locate the service in the Services console app. It will be named "Biome." It will be set to start automatically and run under the `Local System` account. You may of course change the startup type and/or account identity in the service's properties.

## Uninstallation

To uninstall the Biome service, run:

```
bio pkg exec biome/windows-service uninstall
```

This will stop the service if it is running and uninstall it from the Windows Service Control Manager (SCM).

## Supervisor Logs

The Biome Supervisor logs will be located in `$env:systemdrive\hab\svc\windows-service\logs`. The log will rotate every 10MB and will archive up to 10 log files. These rotation settings are configurable (see below).

## Configuring the Biome service

You may configure the Biome service using its configuration file located at `$env:systemdrive\hab\svc\windows-service\BioService.dll.config`. Here you can configure arguments to be passed to `bio run` and whether to include debug verbosity in the logs.

The settings located in the `appSettings` section of the configuration file may include:

* `debug` - When any value other than `false`, this will cause the service logs to include very verbose debug logging. This is likely only helpful to a Biome developer troubleshooting problems with the Biome Supervisor.
* `launcherArgs` - Arguments to forward on to `bio run`. You can see `bio run --help` for details but here you may pass peer information or override supervisor ports.
* `launcherPath` - The absolute path of the `bio-launch.exe` to invoke which will start the supervisor. By default this will point to the latest version of the launcher installed. This is useful by Biome developers for debugging the Biome launcher.

The Biome Windows service uses [log4net](https://logging.apache.org/log4net/) to control where logs are saved and how they are rotated. You likely do not want to change these settings but if you are familiar with `log4net` logging appenders, you can certainly change these settings. All of the log4net configuration is located in `$env:systemdrive\hab\svc\windows-service\log4net.xml`.

## Considerations for setting the Biome service identity

By default the Biome service will run under `Local System` and should have adequate permissions for running Biome services. You may specify in your service `plan.ps1` a specific identity (`pkg_svc_user`) that you want an individual Biome service to run as and the Biome Supervisor (running under the Windows service) will launch that service with the specified identity. Note that identity must have the right to run as a service. If you do not specify a `pkg_svc_user` in your plan, the service will run under the same identity as the Windows service (`Local System` by default).

If you would like to have the Windows service run under an identity other than `Local System`, keep the following in mind:

* You may not use `Network Service` because that identity is given minimum local privileges and may not be able to access processes that the supervisor needs to access. For example, if the Supervisor cannot gracefully terminate a service, it will forcefully terminate the process along with all child processes. The `Network Service` does not have rights to terminate a process.
* The configured account must have local administrator privileges and be assigned the following rights:
  * Log on as a service
  * Adjust memory quotas for a process
  * Replace a process level token

The last two assignments are necessary in order for the Biome Windows service to launch Biome services under different identites.

## Running the Service and a Windows Studio on the same machine

You may encounter failures if you attempt to enter a Windows Studio using `bio studio enter` on a machine that is running the Biome Windows service due to port conflicts. Currently this is not a supported scenario and it is recommended that you run the Windows service in non development environments where you do not intend to use a Windows based Studio or use a Docker based Studio via `bio studio enter -D` instead.
