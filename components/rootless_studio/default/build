# Create a wrapper to `build` so that any calls to it have a super-stripped
# `$PATH` and not whatever augmented version is currently in use. This should
# mean that running `build` from inside a `studio enter` and running `studio
# build` leads to the exact same experience, at least as far as initial
# `$PATH` is concerned.
