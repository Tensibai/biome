# This tests that removing the leader from a functioning leader topology
# service group that has enough nodes to maintain quorum after the leader is
# lost, it will continue to perform a succesful rolling update after a new
# leader is elected.
#
# We will load services on three nodes and then stop the supervisor on
# the leader node prompting a new election where one of the two follower nodes
# becomes a leader. Next we perform an update and expect both nodes to update.
# Prior to https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/pull/7167, the update after a
# new leader is elected would never occur because the new leader would continue
# to behave like a follower and wait for instructions to update.
