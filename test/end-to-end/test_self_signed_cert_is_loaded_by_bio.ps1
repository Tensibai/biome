# This tests that a self-signed certificate in the cache is loaded 
# by bio. We don't have a way to inspect loaded certificates at this
# time, so we rely on inspecting debug output which is less than ideal.
# As we improve our pipeline, this test could be replaced by attemting 
# to talk to a builder service with a self-signed cert.
