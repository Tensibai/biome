# Installing the launcher here because TESTING_FS_ROOT is an imperfect
# abstraction that needs to be removed. It turns out that even if
# TESTING_FS_ROOT is in place, we still look for the launcher in
# `/bio` when we start up.
#
# Once we remove TESTING_FS_ROOT completely, we'll need to rethink how
# this test works, since we can't really make `/` read-only
